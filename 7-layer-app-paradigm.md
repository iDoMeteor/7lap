# 7 Layer Application Paradigm (7LAP)

## Context

## The 6 Layers Almost Every Modern App Requires

  * **Application Stack**
  The technologies, components, APIs, packages and layers of your application, from project root inward exclusive of static assets and inclusive of all *actionable code* which shall, at some point, be compiled or interpreted.
  * **Assets**
  Files (typically) that are not executed or compiled and passed to the client without processing.  File types such as CSS, fonts and images are almost always considered static assets, but an asset (or *static asset* if you prefer) has no restriction on file type.  Any *dynamically* constructed element ceases to be considered an asset for our purposes.  A file which is generated by a pre-processor, for instance, becomes an asset while the file processed by the pre-processor shall be considered actionable code.  Technically a static sub-set of your application stack or data sets.
  * **Data Sets**
  All data is data, so to speak.  Your program is, in fact, data.  But in this context the reference is to actual data collected and processed by your program in some way and most likely stored somewhere.  This may be a large distributed database, a collection of spreadsheets, a collection of files (like your database ultimately is), or a collection of bytes in some form of memory buffer (like your database, or file system, could be).  The point is, any container which holds *data-at-rest* shall be considered a data set (or store, collection, table, etc), which therefore may be considered to have state.
  * **Infrastructure**
  Ultimately your program (application stack), assets and data all must live in some physical location(s).  Even if it only exists in your mind.  Whatever physical resources your program requires for one complete deployment is what shall be considered your application's infrastructure.
  * **Program Flow**
  If all your program does is nothing, it is probably very boring.  Program flow defines how a program sends bits of data from one piece, component or service to another.  Whether that other is within the program itself or external to it is of little consequence.  Any movement of data, signal emitted, or side-effect incurred shall be considered part of program flow.  An application's state may be said to be a snapshot of the program's flow frozen in time.
  * **Server Stack**
  This is the system of software and technology that resides between your infrastructure and your application, enabling your software to be executed (or interpreted).  It also generally provides the mechanisms which enable the storage and retrieval of your data, process and resource management.  Logging, monitoring and management tools are always available at this layer, although at times an interface may be provided by the provider of one's infrastructure and one's infrastructure may be logged, monitored and managed from somewhere within one's server stack.

## Icing on the Cake

The 7th layer, **automation** is usually found in highly scaled applications, although applications of any size may utilize it.

Many people want to jump right in and start developing their application infrastructure in a scalable way using automation.  It sounds like a great idea, but in the real world, it can just make everything harder.
